/* PROBLEM STATEMENT
There are 
N
N balls in a row. The 
i
t
h
ith ball has color 
A
i
Ai. You have to destroy all of the balls by using the following operation any number of times.

Operation: Let the current number of balls be 
k
k. All the balls of color 
k
k are destroyed at the same moment. Given the different scenarios, tell whether you will be able to destroy all the balls or not.

Input Format:
First line contains 
t
t, the number of test cases. 
Each of the test case contains an integer 
N
N, the number of balls. 
Next line contains 
N
N space separated integers corresponding to the color of balls.

Output Format: 
For each test case, print “YES”(without quotes) if all balls can be destroyed otherwise “NO”.

Sample Input

1 3 3 6 6 6
Sample Output
YES
Explanation
Initially, there are 
6
6 balls. Now, all balls having color equal to 
6
6 are destroyed together at the same moment. Now, there are 
3
3 balls remaining.

All balls having color equal to 
3
3 are destroyed together at this moment. Now, there is only 
1
1 ball remaining. All balls having color equal to 
1
1 are destroyed together at this moment.

After this operation, all balls have been destroyed. Thus, the answer is yes.
